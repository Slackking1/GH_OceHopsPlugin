Clone this repository to you rhino packages, typically found under user/app data/roaming/rhino....
When placed here the .ghuser objects is loaded into rhino, and you avoid clutter with user defined .ghuser,
Further more it gives the option to centrally manage the .ghuser files without the need for actual distribution through eg. food4Rhino.
